	<pre style="font-family:Ink Free;font-size:130%;text-align:center;color:black;font-weight:bold;">
	Nasi kerabu is a Malay rice dish, a type of nasi ulam, in which
	blue-coloured rice is eaten with dried fish or fried chicken, 
	crackers, pickles and other salads. The blue colour of the rice 
	comes from the petals of Clitoria ternatea (butterfly-pea) 
	flowers (bunga telang) used in cooking it. The rice can also be 
	cooked with plain white rice or rice cooked using turmeric. It is 
	often eaten with solok lada and is also eaten with fried keropok.
	Nasi kerabu is very popular in the east coast states of Peninsular 
	Malaysia such as Kelantan and Terengganu, and now can be found 
	throughout Malaysia as well as in southern Thailand where it is 
	known as khao yam (Thai: ข้าวยำ, pronounced [kʰâːw jam]).</pre>

	<pre style="font-family:Ink Free;font-size:130%;text-align:center;color:black;font-weight:bold;">
	Malaysian cuisine consists of cooking traditions and practices 
	found in Malaysia, and reflects the multi-ethnic makeup of its population. 
	The vast majority of Malaysia's population can roughly be divided among 
	three major ethnic groups: Malays, Chinese and Indians. The remainder 
	consists of the indigenous peoples of Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia, 
	the Orang Asli of Peninsular Malaysia, the Peranakan and Eurasian creole 
	communities, as well as a significant number of foreign workers and expatriates.

	<pre style="font-family:Ink Free;font-size:130%;text-align:center;color:black;font-weight:bold;">
	Gỏi cuốn, Vietnamese spring roll, fresh spring roll, spring roll, or rice paper roll,
	is a Vietnamese dish traditionally consisting of pork, prawn, vegetables, 
	bún (rice vermicelli), and other ingredients wrapped in Vietnamese bánh tráng 
	(commonly known as rice paper or cold roll). Like other spring roll dishes, 
	they are believed to have an origin in China and were introduced to Vietnam by 
	Chinese immigrants although the gỏi cuốn has been modified to suit local tastes.
	Gỏi cuốn are served fresh while others are served fried, like the Vietnamese chả giò.
	They are served at room temperature (or cooled) and are not deep-fried or cooked on 
	the outside. These rolls are considered to be a very popular appetizer with customers 
	in Vietnamese restaurants.
