	<pre style="font-family:Ink Free;font-size:130%;text-align:center;color:black;font-weight:bold;">
	The Maldives officially the Republic of Maldives, is a small island nation 
	in South Asia, located in the Arabian Sea of the Indian Ocean. It lies southwest 
	of Sri Lanka and India, about 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) from the Asian continent. 
	The chain of 26 atolls stretches from Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in the north to Addu 
	Atoll in the south to the equator. Comprising a territory spanning roughly 298 square 
	kilometres (115 sq mi), the Maldives is one of the world's most geographically 
	dispersed sovereign states as well as the smallest Asian country by land area and 
	population, with around 515,696 inhabitants. Malé is the capital and the most populated 
	city, traditionally called the "King's Island" where the ancient royal dynasties ruled 
	for its central location.</pre>

	<pre style="font-family:Ink Free;font-size:130%;text-align:center;color:black;font-weight:bold;">
	Navagio Beach (Greek: Ναυάγιο, pronounced [naˈvaʝio]), or Shipwreck Beach, 
	is an exposed cove, sometimes referred to as "Smugglers Cove", on the coast 
	of Zakynthos, in the Ionian Islands of Greece. Navagio Beach was originally 
	known as Agios Georgios. On 2 October 1980, the coaster MV Panagiotis,ran 
	aground in the waters around Zakynthos Island on Navagio Beach during stormy 
	weather and bad visibility. Some rumours claim the ship was smuggling contraband; 
	however official sources did not confirm this, and the captain was not convicted 
	for such offences. In fact, after the captain alerted the authorities, 29 locals 
	were convicted of looting the cargo and valuable equipment from the wrecked ship. 
	The ship was abandoned and still rests buried in the limestone gravel of the beach 
	that now bears the nickname Shipwreck. The location was prominently featured in 
	the hit Korean drama Descendants of the Sun, leading to a surge of interest among 
	Chinese and Korean tourists.</pre>
